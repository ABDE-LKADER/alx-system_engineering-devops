<h2> One server web infrastructure</h2>
<p>That hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com</p>

__*Specifics About This Infrastructure:*__
What is a server?
A server is either a computer hardware or software that provides services to other computers, usually referred to as clients.

What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name serves as a human-friendly alias for an IP address. It provides an easier way for users to recognize and remember websites rather than using numerical IP addresses directly. The mapping of domain names to IP addresses is managed by the Domain Name System (DNS).

What type of DNS record does www.foobar.com use?
www.foobar.com uses an A record. This record type stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address in the DNS.

What is the role of the web server?
The web server is responsible for accepting HTTP or HTTPS requests from clients (usually web browsers) and responding by serving the content of the requested resource or returning an error message.

What is the role of the application server?
The application server's role is to install, operate, and host applications and their associated services for end-users, IT services, or organizations. It facilitates the hosting and delivery of high-end consumer or business applications.

What is the role of the database?
The database's role is to maintain a well-organized collection of information that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It stores data for the application and allows for efficient retrieval and storage.

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?
The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet network through the TCP/IP protocol suite.

__*Issues With This Infrastructure*__
There are multiple Single Points Of Failure (SPOF) in this infrastructure. For example, if the MySQL database server goes down, the entire website would be inaccessible.

Downtime is experienced when maintenance is needed. Since there is only one server hosting all components, any maintenance checks or updates would require taking the components or the entire server offline, resulting in downtime for the website.

Scaling becomes difficult if there is too much incoming traffic. With all components on a single server, it can quickly become overwhelmed with traffic, leading to slow response times or crashes. The lack of scalability may hinder the website's ability to handle increased user demand effectively.
